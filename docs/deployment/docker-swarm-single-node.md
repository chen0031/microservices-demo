## Sock Shop via Docker Swarm(Single-Node)

Please refer to the [new Docker Swarm introduction](http://container-solutions.com/hail-new-docker-swarm/)

### Blockers

Currently, new Docker Swarm does not support running containers in privileged mode.
Maybe it will be allowed in the future.
Please refer to the issue [1030](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/issues/1030#issuecomment-232299819).
This prevents running Weave Scope in a normal way, since it needs privileged mode.
A work around exists documented [here](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope-global-swarm-service)

Running global plugins is not supported either.

### Pre-requisities

* Docker For Mac (limited to a single node)

### How-to using Docker For Mac

* Put your docker into the swarm mode
* Execute the services startup script
* Navigate to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> to verify that the demo works.

<!-- deploy-test-start pre-install -->

    docker swarm init 2>/dev/null
    sh ./start-swarmkit-services.sh

<!-- deploy-test-end -->

### Run tests

There's a load test provided as a service in this compose file. For more information see [Load Test](#loadtest).  
It will run when the compose is started up, after a delay of 60s. This is a load test provided to simulate user traffic to the application.
This will send some traffic to the application, which will form the connection graph that you view in Scope or Weave Cloud. 

You may also choose to run the following command to check the health of the deployment.

<!-- deploy-test-start run-tests -->

    i=0
    STATUS=0
    while [ $STATUS -ne 200 ] || [ $i -lt 5 ]; do
        sleep 60
        STATUS=$(curl -4 -s -o output.txt -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost/health?nodes=user,catalogue,cart,shipping,payment,orders)
        i=$((i+1))
    done
    cat output.txt | jq && rm output.txt

    if [ $STATUS -ne 200 ]; then
        echo "$(tput setaf 1)DEPLOY FAILED$(tput sgr0)"
        exit 1
    fi

<!-- deploy-test-end -->

### Cleaning up

<!-- deploy-test-start destroy-infrastructure -->

    sh ./start-swarmkit-services.sh cleanup

<!-- deploy-test-end -->
